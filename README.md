# VehicleSimulator using C++

This project is aim to detect the car plate and read the characters under a complex background. 
Some example of images are including as following:

# Steps for localising the car plate and perform recognition
1. Grayscaling
2. Convert to Binary
3. Invert the image
4. Stepping 
5. Darken
6. Averaging
7. Average Max
8. EqualiseHistogram
9. Vertical Sobel
10. Horizontal Sobel
11. Laplacian 
12. Dilation and Erosion
13. OTSU for character reading
